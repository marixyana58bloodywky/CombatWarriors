## 🧠 How It Works

The **combat warriors script auto parry** listens for attack animations and executes a block command just before impact. This feature is crucial for surviving in close combat scenarios, especially when facing aggressive melee users.

The **combat warriors script aimbot** uses raycasting to automatically aim at opponents' vital zones. You can toggle it on and off to maintain balance if you’re aiming for more discreet gameplay.

Meanwhile, the **combat warriors script hitbox** gives you a slight edge by making it easier to hit enemies even if your aim isn’t perfect — useful for both ranged and melee combat.

Combined with the **combat warriors script pc** and **combat warriors script mobile** variants, the features offer seamless control and flexibility across platforms.
